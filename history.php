        <p class="main-p">Engineering Bureau Franke International LLC has been successfully operating in the field of inspection services for over 40 years. It was founded as an independent company in 1973 in Germany.</p>
        <p class="main-p">In 2006, as part of the business expansion strategy, it was decided to create a subsidiary, Engineering Bureau Franke International (IBFI). The basis for this decision was the analysis of growth trends in demand for the provision of highly professional inspection services in the steel markets in the CIS and Asia.</p>
        <p class="main-p">In 2007, a subsidiary company “IBFI” LLC was established on the territory of the Russian Federation. This step was planned due to the expansion of demand for such type of services as technical supervision during production in heavy industry (metallurgy, mechanical engineering, car building, boiler building, etc.) and technical supervision of construction in the oil and gas industry. Thanks to this, new directions in the provision of services in this industry were opened, a joint venture was created and many reliable partners were found around the world.</p>
